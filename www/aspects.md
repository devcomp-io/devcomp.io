Overview
========

A system is composed of many components and aspects.

Each aspect requires attention and one must look at all aspects combined, each aspect as a whole and all aspects individually within each component.

The aspects we consider are:

  * Persistence
  * Data Containers
  * Natives
  * Primitives
  * Abstractions
  * Domain Specific Languages
  * Runtime Containers - Runtime environments for Domain Specific Languages
  * Programs - Groups of Containers organized into generic shells
  * Distributions - Programs tuned for specific environments
  * Applications - Programs tuned for specific purposes
  * Audiences - Applications tuned for specific groups of users
  * Profiles - Applications tuned for specific users
  * Network - Agreed and broadcast profile interaction contracts
  * Data - All system/environment interaction and original content belonging to user

When considering an application such as a blogging website, break it down into the above aspects and record all the patterns built into the application's programmed logic in JSON-based mata data. Then go deeper and break down all components of the application.

You will see that the above aspects apply at many levels and you will see many patterns emerge.

devcomp.io will integrate a meta system that exposes this data to powerful graphical user interfaces and a realtime manipulation system that
can affect changes in physically deployed systems as rapid the underlying code and resource manipulation pipelines allow.
