Overview
========

Code runs in containers. We are seeking to run code in the following containers.

By running code in a container we mean being able to provision a container, load code in it, interact with it and clean it up when done
all in an automated fashion. Only when this end-to-end cycle flows would we even consider releasing any code to end users.

If you can help integrate containers, please do.
